# Solus Deepin

## I'm a dragon, hear me roar!

### It is *probably* broken, and could remain so forever.

This is an exercise in packaging Deepin.
It is not ready - nor intended - for production use, and it *will not* go into the Solus repos (upstream Solus won't take it, I won't submit it and take on that responsibility).

If you do try this, running it on your production machine is a terrible idea - it'll probably bork a number of things.
